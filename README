This directory contains bench-marks derived from the glibc testsuite to test
standard C library functions (memcpy, strcpy, etc) and ad-hoc bench-marks for
some compiler features. The tests either generate an image suitable for
running on the simulator or a u-boot image to be run on the target. We only
generate the test images, execution requires manual effort.

Common options:

NEWLIBDIR=<path to newlib sources>

TARGET=<triplet>,
	empty assumes native host (x86)
	else, must define:
	      TOOLS=<path to toolchain root>

ENDIAN=(EL|EB)		  - default little endian

CORE=<core>		  - overrides -march= option

ABI=(n64|n32|o32) 	  - ABI for MIPS, defaults to p32 for nanoMIPS

SIM=[01]		  - select simulator or u-boot output


Make targets are: all clean
